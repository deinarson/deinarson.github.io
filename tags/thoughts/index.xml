      <description>Thoughts on Semi-Automated Threat Detection or Hunting These are merely musings, and by no means an exhaustive list, nor is it intended to be of the quality of a professional publication; lacking references and use of pronouns. However, I wish to bring to light some issues.

      <description>Barlow&amp;rsquo;s Principles of Adult Behaviour  Be patient. No matter what. Don’t badmouth: Assign responsibility, not blame. Say nothing of another you wouldn’t say to him. Never assume the motives of others are, to them, less noble than yours are to you. Expand your sense of the possible. Don’t trouble yourself with matters you truly cannot change. Expect no more of anyone than you can deliver yourself. Tolerate ambiguity. Laugh at yourself frequently.</description>
