## Thinking aloud

> To all who read this; In the following, if you feel that I am judging the work that you have done, or trying to suggest complicity, this is not the case. I am specifically writing about the potential future misuse of a system.  With all our knowable efforts we can only do the best we can, but we only have one life, and once we are gone we can no longer insure every one of our good intentions will be followed by our successors.

A practical example is, Jesus was a jew, but 300 years after his death Christians could not agree on how to follow him. Even in the last hundred years we have have religious groups find new ways of following him. We assume all the other ways where not good enough.


## Are we aware of what is already going on?
This is not a bout Nazi's nor Hitler, this is just a question about a starting point for our future.

At the moment that Hitler decided to go in to politics, it was very unlikely that anyone in the world could have imagined that any single human being could have influenced such outcomes. Note that before and during the war Hitler still had supporters inside various governments obviously ignorant to the atrocities that were underway. Today this might sound outrageous, however, it seemed that the true impact of the Nazi's was not popular knowledge. This was highlighted in the documentary "blind spot", where the interviews with Hitlers secretary explained that she had no understanding of the violence until much later in the 1960s... And to be more to the point, even after the second world war a [Canadian politician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9al_Caouette) referred to Hitler as his political hero. Today, we assume, no one in the world would dare say such a thing, even if they did think it.


In 2014 Edward Snowden stated that the mass surveillance system the US was creating would be a perfect turn-key system for tyranny.

## Slippery slope?
Perhaps we are already on the slippery slope? Maybe we should all step back and contemplate what we are arguing about before saying _we have nothing to hide_.  There was a time when we proudly claimed "freedom of religion. and freedom of belief", but then cam McCarthyism and it seemed that if you "...were or ever had been..." was something that should be illegal.

### Example 
In recent memory the many of the medias and racists have issued propaganda claiming any follower of islam or person of eastern descent wearing traditional clothing as a terrorist. Officials in positions of power making blanket statements like "over 80% of people in mosques are supporters of terrorists".  Imagine the fervour of McCarthyism now, but keep in mind we have started to use inhuman treatment of people just crossing the boarders.

Now imagine this person of power in control of every moment of your life and all of the information you bleed via your internet usage and cellular activities.  -- I am worried for the many good people I know of being dragged into this mess merely because someone with power decides to "correct" what they don't like.

If you don't want to give me your password so I can look at all your emails you do have something to hide, what you don't realize is that most of the worlds email is stored in google somewhere... so it is accessible
